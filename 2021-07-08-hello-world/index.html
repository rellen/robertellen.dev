This is an interesting choice, as SSGs aren’t necessarily in Elixir’s wheelhouse. However, since Elixir is my current language of choice for my work at <a href="https://alembic.com.au/" title="">Alembic</a> and side-projects, I thought it would be fitting to try to use it to make a static blog site.</p><p>Getting a basic site with no styles and practically no content up and running was initially quite easy. I’ve taken a lot of cues from the <a href="https://gabrielpoca.com/" title="">personal site</a> of Still’s author, Gabriel Poça. Borrowing from there, I was able to get a blog pipeline going that takes markdown files and produces templated HTML files.</p><p>Still is evolving rapidly and I’ve had to adapt the skeleton of my site in-place to keep up with the latest. The most challenging upgrade was making the move to Snowpack so that working with the JS/npm world is made easier (ironic, no?). But in all seriousness, the changes were worth it because it’s made using <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" title="">TailwindCSS</a> more straight forward.</p><p>At the time of writing this post, the site is not styled well at all. I hope to update it as I go, but for now, it’s workable. It’s at a point where posts like this one can actually be published.</p><h2>The blog</h2><p>Going forward, I intend to blog about tech and tech life.</p><p>I’m a software engineer with experience in full-stack web development, industrial control systems software, telecommunications, and other systems software. As mentioned, Elixir is my main language at the moment, and I also work on Javascript or Typescript frontends (mostly using Next.js). I’m a fan of the BEAM, functional programing, and real-time systems, and I’d really like to get back into hardware, embedded systems, and (I)IoT. So, I expect I’ll write about things like that.</p><p>I have also had a somewhat-unusual career path, and feel like its course took an interesting turn a few years ago. For over a decade, I was working in a niche field of software engineering, in a situation that meant I wasn’t able to use a lot of mainstream tech and development practices. Then, out of the blue, I got an opportunity to join a team that was much closer to what’s typical in most development shops. That course change will also be good to write about, because I believe it gives me some insights into how to break into the industry as a newcomer. The journey I am on may be of interest to some developers, either starting out at a later stage in life, or coming into mainstream software engineering from niche domains. Without wanting to preempt my future writing on this, I think the main leason to learn is to, in whatever capacity you can, keep in touch with the mainstream without wasting time on the hype.</p><h2>The end of the beginning</h2><p>Working with Still to get this blog going has been fun and rewarding. I’m excited to write my first non-‘Hello, world!!!’ post soon so that I can go legit. See you there!</p></article></div><div class="text-center"><a href="/" class="no-underline hover:underline">Back Home</a></div><footer class="flex justify-center mt-6"><p>Built using <a href="https://github.com/still-ex/still" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="underline">Still</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="underline">TailwindCSS</a></p></footer></body></html>
