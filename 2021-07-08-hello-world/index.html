<p>After a little bit of tinkering, I&#39;m going live with robertellen.dev, a blog about technology and developer life.</p>

<h2>The tech</h2>

<p>You can see in the footer of the page that I&#39;m using <a href="https://stillstatic.io/">Still</a>, a static-site generator (SSG) written in Elixir. 
This is an interesting choice, as SSGs aren&#39;t necessarily in Elixir&#39;s wheelhouse.
However, since Elixir is my current language of choice for my work at <a href="https://alembic.com.au/">Alembic</a> and side-projects, I thought it would be fitting to try to use it to make a static blog site.</p>

<p>Getting a basic site with no styles and practically no content up and running was initially quite easy.
I&#39;ve taken a lot of cues from the <a href="https://gabrielpoca.com/">personal site</a> of Still&#39;s author, Gabriel Po√ßa.
Borrowing from there, I was able to get a blog pipeline going that takes markdown files and produces templated HTML files.</p>

<p>Still is evolving rapidly and I&#39;ve had to adapt the skeleton of my site in-place to keep up with the latest.
The most challenging upgrade was making the move to Snowpack so that working with the JS/npm world is made easier (ironic, no?).
But in all seriousness, the changes were worth it because it&#39;s made using <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a> more straight forward.</p>

<p>At the time of writing this post, the site is not styled well at all.
I hope to update it as I go, but for now, it&#39;s workable.
It&#39;s at a point where posts like this one can actually be published.</p>

<h2>The blog</h2>

<p>Going forward, I intend to blog about tech and tech life.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a software engineer with experience in full-stack web development, industrial control systems software, telecommunications, and other systems software.
As mentioned, Elixir is my main language at the moment, and I also work on Javascript or Typescript frontends (mostly using Next.js).
I&#39;m a fan of the BEAM, functional programing, and real-time systems, and I&#39;d really like to get back into hardware, embedded systems, and (I)IoT.
So, I expect I&#39;ll write about things like that.</p>

<p>I have also had a somewhat-unusual career path, and feel like its course took an interesting turn a few years ago.
For over a decade, I was working in a niche field of software engineering, in a situation that meant I wasn&#39;t able to use a lot of mainstream tech and development practices.
Then, out of the blue, I got an opportunity to join a team that was much closer to what&#39;s typical in most development shops.
That course change will also be good to write about, because I believe it gives me some insights into how to break into the industry as a newcomer.
The journey I am on may be of interest to some developers, either starting out at a later stage in life, or coming into mainstream software engineering from niche domains.
Without wanting to preempt my future writing on this, I think the main leason to learn is to, in whatever capacity you can, keep in touch with the mainstream without wasting time on the hype.</p>

<h2>The end of the beginning</h2>

<p>Working with Still to get this blog going has been fun and rewarding.
I&#39;m excited to write my first &#39;Hello, world!!!&#39; post soon so that I can go legit.
See you there!</p>
