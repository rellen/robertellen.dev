### Getting up and running with PromEx
PromEx [https://github.com/akoutmos/prom_ex](https://github.com/akoutmos/prom_ex) is a fantastic library that turns BEAM telemetry events into metrics that can be scraped by the Prometheus timeseries monitoring system. It also has the added feature of providing some in-built Grafana charts that can be uploaded directly to a Grafana instance.

In this talk we will walk through setting up a local PromEx environment including Prometheus and Grafana with Docker to show how quickly you can get some metrics going in your Elixir applications.
